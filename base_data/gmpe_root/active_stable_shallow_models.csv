    The GMPE distinguishes between rock (vs30 >= 600) and deep soil
    (vs30 < 600). The rake angle is also taken into account to distinguish
    between 'reverse' (45 <= rake < 135) and 'other'. If an earthquake rupture
    is classified as 'reverse', then the hanging-wall term is included in the
    mean calculation.

    The original code by the author was not made available at the time of
    development of this code. For this reason, this implementation is untested.

    It appears from the model documentation that the CBD dL2L and dS2S are
    relative to a baseline Vs30 value of 250 m/s and a baseline Z1 value of
    330 m, although this is unconfirmed.

    Only the CBD subregion dS2S term is implemented here, because of
    difficulties defining the boundaries of other subregions. Full details
    behind the choices here are detailed in:

    motion prediction models for Europe"", Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering
    12, 495-516

    The GMPE is derived from an artifical neural network approach, and
    therefore does not assume the form of source, path and site scaling that is
    conventionally adopted by GMPEs. Instead the influence of each variable
    is modelled via a hyperbolic tangent-sigmoid function which is then applied
    to the vector of normalised predictor variables. As a consequence the
    expected ground motion for each site is derived from a set of matrix
    products from the respective weighting and bias vectors. This means that
    vectorisation by ctx cannot be achieved and a loop is implemented
    instead.

    The GMPE is used by the National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project (NSHMP) for
    the 2008 central and eastern US hazard model.

    This class replicates the algorithm as implemented in
    ``subroutine getFEA`` in the ``hazgridXnga2.f`` Fortran code available
    at: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/2008/software/

    The GMPE is defined by a set of lookup tables (see Appendix A) defined
    from minimum magnitude Mw=4.4 to maximum magnitude Mw=8.2, and from
    (hypocentral) distance 10 km to 1000 km. Values outside these range
    are clipped.

    Lookup tables are defined for PGA, and SA at the following periods: 0.1,
    0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0. The GMPE does not allow for interpolation on
    unsupported periods.

    The class assumes rupture magnitude to be in Mblg scale (given that
    MFDs for central and eastern US are given in this scale). However lookup
    tables are defined for Mw. Therefore Mblg is converted to Mw by using
    Atkinson and Boore 1987 conversion equation.

    Coefficients are given for the B/C site conditions.

    The GMPE is desiged for regional adaptation within a logic-tree framework,
    and as such contains several parameters that can be calibrated on input:
    1) Source-region scaling, a simple scalar factor that defines how much
    to increase or decrease the ""regional average"" ground motion in the region.
    This value is taken as the maximum of the source-region variability term
    (tau_l2l) and the statistical uncertainty (sigma_mu). The latter defines
    the within-model uncertainty owing to the data set from which the model is
    derived and only exceeds the former at large magnitudes
    2) Residual attenuation scaling ""c3"", a factor that controls the residual
    attenuation part of the model to make the ground motion decay more or less
    rapidly with distance than the regional average.
    Both factors are period dependent.
    The two adaptable factors can be controlled either by direct specification
    at input (in the form of an imt-dependent dictionary) or by a number of
    standard deviations multiplying the existing variance terms. The two
    approaches are mutually exclusive, with the directly specified parameters
    always being used if defined on input.
    In the core form of the GMPE no site term is included. This is added in the
    subclasses.

        Parameter to control the source-region scaling as a number of
        standard deviations by which to multiply the source-region to source-

    :param float c3_epsilon:

    of Earthquake Engineering, 18:5087 - 5117
    There are three key adaptations of the original Kotha et al. (2020) GMM:
    1) The use of the residual attenuation regions, which represent the five
    main sub-regions of Europe with similar attenuation characteristics. The
    assignment to a particular group is now a site-dependent property,
    requiring the definition of the ""eshm20_region"", an integer value between
    0 and 5 indicating the residual attenuation region to which the site
    belongs (1 - 5) or else the default values (0). For each region an expected
    c3 and variance, tau_c3, are defined from which the resulting c3 is taken
    as a multiple of the number of standard deviations of tau_c3.
    2) The site amplification is defined using a two-segment piecewise linear
    linear function. This form of the GMPE defines the site in terms of a
    measured or inferred Vs30, with the total aleatory variability adjusted
    accordingly.
    3) A magnitude-dependent heteroskedastic aleatroy uncertainty model is

    This class implements the GMPE for Active Shallow Crust
    earthquakes (Asc suffix).

    The GMPE distinguishes between rock, stiff soil and soft soil
    which respectively equate to the New Zealand site class combined A/B
    C, and D. No model is provided for New Zealand site class E
    The rake angle is also taken into account to
    distinguish between faulting mechanisms. A hanging-wall term is noted in
    the functional form of the model in the paper but is not used at present.
    Furthermore, a Rvolc (volcanic path distance) is noted in the functional
    form but this is not implemented in the McVerry2006Asc model, it is
    implemented in a seperate GMPE McVerry2006Volc where Rvol=Rrup as this
    is how it is implemented in Stirling et al. 2012.

    This is a legacy class based on the original implementation of McVerry
    et al. (2006), where the site terms are incorrectly implemented as
    functions of Vs30. The New Zealand site classification boundaries do not
    depend on Vs30 and so this class will yield erroneous results for some
    site locations. Instead, calling `McVerry2006AscSC` and specifying site
    class values in the .ini file will give the correct results.

    Consequently ground motions are generated via numerical simulations using
    a stochastic point-source model, calibrated with parameters derived from
    local weak-motion data. This implementation applies to the case

    Himalayas. The combination of these two regions is motivated by the
    sparsity of near field data. Seismotectonic similarity is supposed
    based on both regions being continental collision zones, and in spite
    of the lack of subduction in Zagros.

    Note that Figure 7-9 of Sharma et al. (2009) are in error (Sharma,
    personal communication). This implementation is verified against test
    vector obtained from lead author.

    Support for PGA has been added by assuming it to be equal to the spectral

    of the standard deviation model used for the bedrock case. The epistemic
    uncertainty can be added to the model by the user input site_epsilon term,
    which describes the number of standard deviations by which to multiply
    the epistemic uncertainty model, to then be added or subtracted from the
    median amplification model

    Adaptation of the Kotha et al. (2020) GMPE for application to the
    2020 European Seismic Hazard Model, as described in Weatherill et al.
    (2020)
    Weatherill, G., Kotha, S. R. and Cotton, F. (2020) ""A regionally-adaptable
    'scaled-backbone' ground motion logic tree for shallow seismicity in
    Europe: application to the 2020 European seismic hazard model"". Bulletin
    of Earthquake Engineering, 18:5087 - 5117
    There are three key adaptations of the original Kotha et al. (2020) GMM:
    1) The use of the residual attenuation regions, which represent the five
    main sub-regions of Europe with similar attenuation characteristics. The
    assignment to a particular group is now a site-dependent property,
    requiring the definition of the ""eshm20_region"", an integer value between
    0 and 5 indicating the residual attenuation region to which the site
    belongs (1 - 5) or else the default values (0). For each region an expected
    c3 and variance, tau_c3, are defined from which the resulting c3 is taken
    as a multiple of the number of standard deviations of tau_c3.
    2) The site amplification is defined using a two-segment piecewise linear
    linear function. This form of the GMPE defines the site in terms of a
    measured or inferred Vs30, with the total aleatory variability adjusted
    accordingly.
    3) A magnitude-dependent heteroskedastic aleatroy uncertainty model is
    used for the region-corrected between-event residuals and the site-
    corrected within event residuals. The former taken from the ""global"" tau
    model of Al Atik (2015), while the later is adapted from the ""global"" phi0
    model of Al Atik (2015) adapted to the distribution of site-corrected
    within-event residuals determined by the original regression of Kotha et
    al. (2020).

    This class implements a variation of the Kotha et al (2020; 2022) GMM that
    was used for the ESHM20, but here the predicted intensity measure is
    average SA (AvgSA) rather than SA. This is a form of direct AvgSA GMM,
    which is fit using the same data set as that of KothaEtAl2020 with AvgSA
    defined according the specifications of (among others) Iacoletti et al.
    (2023):

    AvgSA = sqrt(prod([0.2 x T <= T <= 1.5 x T]))

    where a total of 10 linearly-spaced conditioning periods in the range are
    used to define the average SA.

    As the same regression methods were used to fit AvgSA then all of the
    adjustment terms adopted by the ESHM20 (sigma_mu_epsilon, c3_epsilon,
    ergodic etc.) can be applied to the AvgSA GMM, which allows the same logic
    tree to be constructed for the direct AvgSA case.

    Further details on the compilation and application of the GMM are being
    developed in the following publication (in preparation):

    Weatherill, G (2024) ""A Regionalised Direct AvgSA Ground Motion Model for
    Europe"", (Journal TBC)

    As this is in preparation, futue changes to the model are possible
    so we therefore retain the experimental warning, which will be removed
    at a future date.
