    The GMPE is used by the National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project (NSHMP) for
    the 2008 central and eastern US hazard model.

    This class replicates the algorithm as implemented in
    ``subroutine getFEA`` in the ``hazgridXnga2.f`` Fortran code available
    at: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/conterminous/2008/software/

    The GMPE is defined by a set of lookup tables (see Appendix A) defined
    from minimum magnitude Mw=4.4 to maximum magnitude Mw=8.2, and from
    (hypocentral) distance 10 km to 1000 km. Values outside these range
    are clipped.

    Lookup tables are defined for PGA, and SA at the following periods: 0.1,
    0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0. The GMPE does not allow for interpolation on
    unsupported periods.

    The class assumes rupture magnitude to be in Mblg scale (given that
    MFDs for central and eastern US are given in this scale). However lookup
    tables are defined for Mw. Therefore Mblg is converted to Mw by using
    Atkinson and Boore 1987 conversion equation.

    Magnitudes and Short Distances"" (available at:
    http://www.riskeng.com/downloads/attenuation_equations). The correction

    is computed.
