    From observations of very large events it was found that the magnitude
    scaling term can be adjusted as part of the epistemic uncertainty model.
    The adjustment comes in the form of the parameter DeltaC1, which is
    period dependent for interface events. To capture the epistemic uncertainty
    in DeltaC1, three models are proposed: a 'central', 'upper' and 'lower'
    model. The current class implements the 'central' model, whilst additional
    classes will implement the 'upper' and 'lower' alternatives.

    Whilst the original model provides coefficients for different regional
    variations, these are incomplete for the purpose of a working
    implementation. As the authors indicate in the source, the coefficients
    and adjustment factors are intended only for application to the
    Cascadia region; hence this is the only version implemented here.
    Furthermore, scalar adjustments are intended to be applied in order to
    define an ""upper"", ""central"" and ""lower"" branch to cover the epistemic
    uncertainty of the core model.

    for Subduction Earthquakes based on the NGA-SUB Database"", Pacific
    Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) Technical Report,
    PEER 2020/25

    The model is regionalised, defining specific adjustment factors for
    (invoking region term in parenthesis):

    - Global (""GLO"" - for application to any subduction region for which
      no region-specific adjustment is defined)
    - Alaska (""USA-AK"")
    - Cascadia (""CAS"")
    - Central America & Mexico (""CAM"")
    - Japan (""JPN"")
    - New Zealand (""NZL"")
    - South America (""SAM"")
    - Taiwan (""TWN"")

    The region-specific adjustments primarily affect the constant term,
    the anelastic attenuation term and the linear Vs30 scaling term. In
    addition, however, further period-specific adjustment factors can be
    applied for the Alaska and Cascadia regions using the boolean
    input `apply_adjustment`. These adjustments scale the resulting
    ground motion values to appropriate levels accounting for limited data
    and the Alaska and Cascadia region, based on analysis undertaken by
    the authors.

    A general epistemic uncertainty median adjustment factor is also defined
    based on the standard deviation of the median ground motion from five
    regions with estimated regional terms. This term should be applied only
    to the global model (though this is not strictly enforced), and it is
    controlled via the use of `sigma_mu_epsilon`, the number of standard
    deviations by which the adjustment will be multiplied (default = 0)

    A non-ergodic aleatory uncertainty model can be returned by setting
    `ergodic=False`.

    The code implementation and test tables have been verified using
    Fortran code supplied by Professor N. Abrahamson, and cross-checked against
    an independent implementation from Feng Li, Jason Motha and James Paterson
    from University of Canterbury (New Zealand).

    Ground-Motion Model for Subduction Regions using the NGA-Subduction
    Database"", PEER Technical Report 2020/04, Pacific Earthquake Engineering
    Research Center (PEER)

    The GMM define a ""global"" model as well as a set of region-specific
    coefficients (and in some cases methods). The coefficients are defined for
    eight specific subduction regions (with their region codes):

    - Alaska (USA-AK)
    - Cascadia (CAS)
    - Central America & Mexico (CAM)
    - Japan (JPN)
    - New Zealand (NZL)
    - South America (SAM)
    - Taiwan (TWN)
    - Seattle (SEA)

    In the original model defined by the authors, three of the regions
    (JPN, CAM, SAM) define a forearc/backarc dependent anelastic attenuation
    term. To implement this one needs to define the travel distance through
    each of the attenuation subregions. As of July 2021 this property is not
    supported by the OQ-engine, so on the author's guidance a fixed anelastic
    attenuation term is used in these regions

    For four of the regions (JPN, CAS, NZL, TWN) a basin response term
    requiring Z2.5 or Z1.0 is defined. In these cases either Z2.5 (JPN, CAS)
    or Z1.0 (NZL, TWN) must be specified.

    Two forms of configurable epistemic uncertainty adjustments are supported:

    m_b: The magnitude scaling breakpoint. This term is defined for each region
         and tectonic region type, but this can also be over-ridden by the user

    :param bool m9_basin_term: Apply the M9 basin adjustment

    :param bool usgs_basin_scaling: Scaling factor to be applied to basin term
                                    based on USGS basin model

    sigma_mu_epsilon: Within-model epistemic uncertainty (sigma_mu) is
                      described in Chapter 6 of the report by the authors. This
                      uncertainty is region specific and is described by a
                      magnitude- and distance-dependent standard deviation.
                      The term ""sigma_mu_epsilon"" defines the number of
                      standard deviations above or below the median by which
                      to scale the mean ground motion within a backbone
                      logic tree context. The scenario and period specific
                      sigma_mu values are read in from hdf5 binary files and
                      interpolated to the magnitude and distances required
